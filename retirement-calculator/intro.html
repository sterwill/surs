	<h2>Illinois Pension Reform – Some Sample Numbers</h2>
	<p>
		For several years Illinois politicians and newspaper editorial pages have complained regularly and loudly about the
		State's "pension problem". Pensions for State workers have been characterized as "lucrative" and "unsustainable". The
		impression has been left that Illinois workers' pay and pension benefits are the cause of the State's dire fiscal
		problems. They also propose the way to solve these problems is to "reform" – reduce these benefits. Largely ignored in
		these complaints is that the State has not paid its required share of worker pension benefits for decades. A more
		accurate description of the current situation is that Illinois has a huge <b>debt problem</b> and may, or may not,
		have a "pension problem." The <b>debt problem</b> has been calculated at about $80 billion. Less <span
			class="underline">factual information</span> has been reported about the "pension problem."
	</p>
	<p>In order to take a closer look at the "pension problem", the following pages will afford you the opportunity to
		see sample numbers (mathematical facts) involved in one of the State's several retirement systems. The following model
		emulates the State Universities Retirement System's Traditional, Tier I plan. Presumably, this is one of the plans
		causing Illinois’ fiscal problems. This plan, which includes the majority of SURS employees, has already been
		"reformed" to lower benefits for all future workers.</p>
	<p>Keep in mind that Illinois law excludes all SURS workers from the Nation's "standard retirement plan" – Social
		Security. Illinois has chosen to exclude many of its workers from Social Security on the assumption that the State's
		alternative plan will provide worker benefits at least equal to those provided under Social Security. Since the SURS
		plan requires workers to "contribute" 8% of their gross earnings into their retirement plan (more than they would pay
		under Social Security) it would seem logical that the State would also "contribute" an amount at least equal to the
		Social Security "employer share" of 6.2% of gross earnings. Unfortunately, unlike Social Security, there is no set
		amount the State must pay into its employee retirement plan, only that the State must pay all retirement annuities
		when they are due.</p>
	<p>
		The following model is the sole responsibility of John Terwilliger (a SURS retiree) and has <span class="underline">not
			been approved by SURS</span>. Try it out and decide for yourself what is a fair and sustainable retirement plan. Reform may
		be as simple as the State making regular, required payments into the system.
