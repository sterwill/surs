	<h2>Citizens of Illinois, the other Squeezy warns you!</h2>
	<p>It has come to my attention that a high ranking Illinois politician (who shall remain nameless) has recently
		appropriated a very unflattering likeness of me to shill for him in a campaign designed to misinform Illinois citizens
		about a very serious problem facing all of us.</p>
	<p>
		After decades of the State skipping and shortchanging payments to state workers' retirement funds, this politician now
		calls the situation a “pension problem.” (When I max-out my credit card, I call it what it is – a DEBT problem.)
		Worse, this politician's twisted logic now <span class="underline">blames</span> State workers and retirees (who
		always paid their full share) for this huge DEBT that past Governors and Legislators have <b>willfully and
			deliberately</b> created for Illinois taxpayers. Contrary to what that other “Squeezy” says, there is <span
			class="underline">no pension problem, only a huge DEBT owed to State workers and retirees</span>. This DEBT was <b>deliberately</b>
		foisted on current and future taxpayers by past and current politicians. Now, instead of owning up to the DEBT problem
		<span class="underline">they</span> created, these politicians are attempting to blame “lavish” and “unsustainable”
		public pensions for this huge DEBT. (It seems they will do most anything to avoid taking responsibility for their own
		actions!)
	</p>
	<p style="color: red;">
		Rather than continuing to be a shill for these politicians, <b>I challenge them to prove, with numbers, their
			claims about “lavish” and “unsustainable” pensions</b>! The truth is, pension reform may be as simple as the State paying
		its share along with money they take from workers' pay.
	</p>
	<p>In the following pages, I make my case that the Illinois public pension plan I am a member of, is not lavish, is
		affordable and is a good bargain for employees, retirees and taxpayers. See what you think.</p>
